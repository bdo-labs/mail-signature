BDO mail signature
==================

The mail signature has been changing a lot lately, and I got tired of
handling it. This should make things easier :trollface:

Just edit `template/signature.md` with your favorite editor and run `make`.
At this point you should have an `index.html` that you can replace with
your current mail-signature.

You'll find the syntax-documentation
[here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) if your
unfamiliar with markdown.
